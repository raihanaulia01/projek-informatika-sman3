    <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In the early stages of automation processing, most SCADA/ and historian manufacturers had drivers running directly in their client applications. Although most of these drivers were for their own hardware set, some common protocols were occasionally included (like Modbus).</p>
  <p>The problem that end users encountered was that one manufacturer's client software often could not communicate with another manufacturer's hardware or PLC/DCS. This meant that end users were limited to the product offerings from a single hardware manufacturer. It also limited the potential market forAutomation suppliers, who faced challenges selling their hardware to plants that, had specialized in a different brand.</p>
