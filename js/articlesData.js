    content: `<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>SCADA is not a specific technology, but a type of application. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition â€” any application that gets data about a system in order to control that system is a SCADA application.</p>
    <p>A SCADA has two elements: The process/system/machinery to be monitored. This can be a power plant, a water system, oil and gas plant, and others. The other SCADA element is a Network of an intelligent device that interfaces the first element through sensors and control output. This network, which is SCADA system, gives the ability to measure/monitor and control any specific or overall components on the first element of SCADA.</p>
    <p>This course provides overall SCADA knowledge. All major aspects of SCADA are covered by classroom presentations and laboratory exercises.</p>
    <p>The objective of this course is to equip operators/engineers/supervisors/managers with skills which will enable them to implement SCADA system which will have a definite economic and engineering benefit for process operations. This practical course explains SCADA concepts, SCADA system communications, and visualization.</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>Students completing these courses receive a good grounding in SCADA principles and strategies, Sketch out a SCADA system for potential application in your industry, SCADA HMI development, and various SCADA components.</p>
    <h2>Duration</h2>
    <p>4 Days</p>
    <h2>Course Materials</h2>
    <p>Course note set with slides from course modules</p>
